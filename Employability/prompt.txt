- Chalmers Tekniska Högskola, Sweden
- University of Gothenburg, Sweden
- KTH, Sweden
- Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway
- Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain
- Gdańsk University of Technology, Poland
- Politechnika Warszawska, Poland
- Politecnico di Milano, Italy
- Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Germany
- Technische Universität Berlin, Germany
- Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany
- ETH Zurich, Switzerland
- EPFL, Switzerland
- University of Copenhagen (KU), Denmark
- University of Helsinki (HY), Finland
- University of Cambridge, England
- University of Oxford, England
- University College London (UCL), England
- Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris), France
- Riga Technical University (RTU), Latvia
- University of Tartu (UT), Estonia

Instructions:

1. Data Collection:
Gather employment rate data from reputable sources, including academic publications, official university reports, government statistics, and industry surveys.
Prioritize national sources when available, as they may provide more accurate reflections of true employment outcomes.

2. Scope and Specificity:
Determine whether the reported employment rate is specific to the university or reflects a broader area (e.g., city, region, or country).
Identify whether the employment data is specific to the fields of Computer Science, IT, and ICT or if it covers additional fields.
Specify the educational level for which the employment rate applies (e.g., undergraduate/bachelor’s, postgraduate/masters, or PhD).

3. Data Presentation:
Present your findings in a structured table with the following columns:
University
Country
Employment Rate (as a percentage, a number from 0 to 100)
Year of Reporting
Time frame (e.g., directly upon graduation, 6 months after graduation)
Resource Name
Resource Classification (e.g., official university report, government statistics, industry survey, etc.)
Resource Link
Scope of Employment Rate (e.g., specific to the university, city, municipality, or country)
Field Specificity (e.g., specific to CS, IT, and ICT, or covers all fields)
Degree Level (e.g., undergraduate/bachelor’s, postgraduate/masters, or PhD)
Missing Data:

If any information is unavailable, enter “N/A” in the corresponding cell.

4. Referencing:
Ensure every data point is accurately referenced and that all sources are reliable.
Thank you for your rigorous attention to detail and expert analysis.
