# Survey-of-CSE-Education-in-Sweden-and-Europe

## About
This project is a bachelor thesis with the aim of finding the best parameters to assess university quality. The main focus will be to use data from multiple universities to determine how Chalmers University and the University of Gothenburg can become top educators. 

In this github repository you will find data scraped from the www that concerns:
- Teacher acknowledgements
- Student teacher ratio
- Employability (percent of students that get a job after graduation)
- Student barometers
-  More to come.....

  Inside of the folders you will find scraped data, prompts, sources and figures made with Python.   
  
## Method
The data scraping will be conducted using the latest AI technologies, specifically deep research. By leveraging some of the most powerful LLMs and APIs and combining them with effective prompt engineering, we hope to efficiently and accurately gather data.

## LLMS 
The LLMS planed to be used are: 
- ChatGPT
- DeepSeek R1
- Grok
- Perplexity
- Gemini 

The process will first consist of triangulation. This means that we will utilize multiple LLMs, providing the same prompt to all of them. This ensures that the prompt given is well structured and consistent, as well as verifying the accuracy of the scraped data. By comparing the outputs of the LLMs, we can quickly spot any ambiguities in our prompts.
