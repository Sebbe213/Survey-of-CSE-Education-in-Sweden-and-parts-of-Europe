"A student barometer often has multiple questions that a student is asked to answer. The problem is that different universities ask different questions or formulate them in a different way. 

My task to you is to find the 5 most common questions across different student barometers. 
After you are done I want you to list all the questions in a csv file.

Lastly compose all the links you have used in IEEE format."
