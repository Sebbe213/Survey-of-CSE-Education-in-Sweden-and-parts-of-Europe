1. Established Parameters in Technology University Rankings
1.1 Core Metrics in THE World University Rankings
The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings evaluate institutions based on five pillars:

Teaching (30%)

Research (30%)

Citations (30%)

International Outlook (7.5%)

Industry Income (2.5%)
These metrics derive from 13 performance indicators, including research income, publication volume, citation impact, and reputation surveys. Notably, website quality, campus infrastructure, and geographical location are absent from THEâ€™s formal methodology.
